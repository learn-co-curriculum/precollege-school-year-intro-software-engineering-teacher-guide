# Intro to Software Engineering - Teacher Guide

## Overview - School Year Guide
This repository will act as a course guide for School Year teachers to use Flatiron's Intro to Software Engineering curriculum.
 
Here you'll find:

+ A course outline listing units and topics.
+ A guide for each unit listing resources such as decks, lectures, and labs.
+ A full lecture script as well as abridged notes for each lecture.

Note: Given differing class and course lengths, we have not broken down the material by day or class. We suggest moving through the content in chronological order, adjusting the pace of the course based on the class' ability to comprehend and apply the material in question.
